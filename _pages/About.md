I am a chemical and a process systems engineer and I hold a Ph.D. in applying process systems engineering principles to the early-stage process design problems. Throughout my education, I have also acquired a profound understanding of modeling, simulation, and optimization of engineering processes as well as first hand experiences of algorithm development for data-driven decision making under uncertainty. I am currently working at the Research & Early Development business area of [Novo Nordisk A/S](https://www.novonordisk.com/).
