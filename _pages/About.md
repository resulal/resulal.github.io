A mechanical/chemical engineer with a specialization in process systems engineering (PSE) â€“ a scientific discipline that promotes systematic thinking (e.g., components, subsystems, and subprocesses) to assist often high-stakes engineering decision-making in the design, control, and optimization of process systems. 

In my work, I extensively make use of fundamental PSE techniques along with modern data science algorithms to develop methods/tools that are integrating scales, capturing complex interactions between the components, and quantifying what is at stake. My core competencies lie in modeling, simulation, optimization, and tool/algorithm development for data-driven decision-making under uncertainty. 

I am currently working at the Research & Early Development business area of [Novo Nordisk A/S](https://www.novonordisk.com/) in Denmark.
