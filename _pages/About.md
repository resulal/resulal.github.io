I am a chemical engineer with a specialization in process systems engineering (PSE) â€“ a branch of chemical engineering. In my Ph.D. and current position, I apply process systems engineering techniques to the early-stage process design problems. My core competences lie in modeling, simulation, and optimization of engineering processes and I have extensive experiences with algorithm development for data-driven decision making under uncertainty. 

I am currently working at the Research & Early Development business area of [Novo Nordisk A/S](https://www.novonordisk.com/) in Denmark.
