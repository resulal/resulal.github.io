# Background
First commit for the first blog.


# Setting up Github
GH pages will host what is called a 'static site.' This means that your website is only html, css, and js (no server). You _could_ write the html and css yourself. Alternatively, (as Github recommends), you can use a tool called `Jekyll` to generate a static site for you. You only have to write your blog posts, and you can let Jekyll worry about formatting.
