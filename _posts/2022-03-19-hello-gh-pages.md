This is my first post on GitHub Pages. I plan on using this site to communicate some of the work I've been involved in and allowed to share with public. Creating a personal site on here was among my goals for this year and finally here I am. I hope to be consistent.

### Topics I'm interested in
Research and Development in Biotechnology, Pharmaceuticals, Energy and Process Systems. Process Modeling (mechanistic, data-driven, and hybrid), Simulation and Optimization. Digital Twins. Machine/Deep Learning, Data Science, Advanced Data Visualizations, Surrogate Modeling, Artificial Neural Networks, Gaussian Process Regression. Mathematical Programming, Probabilistic Modeling, Monte Carlo Simulations, Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analysis. Cloud, GPU, Parallel, and Quantum Computing.
